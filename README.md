Robots Who Love Ruby
====================

Robots have long held the fascination of geeks everywhere. As children, many spent countless hours trying to recreate Johnny Five or the Terminator with their Legos. As those geeklings grew up into software developers, the high bar set by electrical engineering often prevented them from walking further down the robotics path, many wistfully dreaming of scratching that childhood itch.

But no longer does that path need to go unexplored. Over the past few years the barriers to building a robot have evaporated with the appearance of platforms like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Lego Mindstorms. In addition to the hardware, developers are also empowered with a wide array of tools to develop for these platforms such as Ruby.

This talk will cover how to use Ruby to build robots all across the spectrum. It will start with "pre-fab" robots like Sphero, move onto Lego Mindstorms NXT, and then finally head to the DIY bots built on Arduino and the Raspberry Pi. It will cover the tools needed, some tips and tricks to get up and hacking quickly, and explore some approaches in real-world working bots.
