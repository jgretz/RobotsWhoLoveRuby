Robots Who Love Ruby
====================
I have always been fascinated by robots. As a child, I would spend countless hours creating robots with Legos and imagination, trying to create my own Johnny Five or Terminator. As I grew up, I headed more in a software direction, yet always had that robotics bug in the back of my head - but the bar of electrical engineering always required too much time I didn't have. In the past few years though, that barrier has all but dissapeared with the creation of platforms like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Lego Mindstorms and I have finally started realizing my childhood dreams (although the full terminator is still in production). 

At the same time I was getting back into robotics, I was also getting deep into Ruby. And as much as I love rehashing my old college days of hacking C, I wanted to marry these two paths, and thus I went down the path of hacking my bots with Ruby. 

In this talk, I want to share what I have learned along the way. We will be covering how to use Ruby to program robots across the spectrum. We will start with "pre-fab" robots like Sphero, move onto Lego Mindstorms, and then finally head to the DIY bots built on Arduino and the Raspberry Pi. We'll cover the tools you need, as well as some tips and tricks to get you up and hacking quickly. Finally we will explore how this approach works in some bots I have built.
